MATLAB Projects

This is a small collection of some of the projects I've done in MATLAB

The fenceCost script creates a fence with a rectangular shape with a semicircular portion and takes the cost values of the straight fencing and the curved fencing to come up with the minimum cost of the materials to achieve an area of a given size.

orbitCalculation creates a table of information known about a few planets in the solar system. Then this information is used to plot the orbit of each planet in a polar coordinate system using matlabs plotting functions.

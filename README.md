MATLAB Projects

This is a small collection of some of the projects I've done in MATLAB

The fenceCost script creates a fence with a rectangular shape with a semicircular portion and takes the cost values of the straight fencing and the curved fencing to come up with the minimum cost of the materials to achieve an area of a given size.

orbitCalculation creates a table of information known about a few planets in the solar system. Then this information is used to plot the orbit of each planet in a polar coordinate system using matlabs plotting functions.

The Tic-Tac-Toe archive contains two different scripts. The first script is simple where a player plays against another player. The second script, projectPlayervBot, pins the player agaisnt different difficulties of bots. The easiest difficulty is the random bot, where the bot randomly places without analyzing the board for a winning opportunity. The next level of difficulty is novice, the novice randomly places until it notices that the opponent has an opportunity to win, in this case it will block the players win. The intermediate difficulty will play similarly to the novice bot but it will take opportunities to win. The expert difficulty analyzes the full board and finds the best outcomes for when it places a move.
